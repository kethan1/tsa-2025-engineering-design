This repository contains the code behind Kethan Vegunta's, Aditya Nalabotu's, Varun Gundamaraju's, and Aarush Tahiliani's submission to the Engineering Design event for the TSA 2025 National Conference in Nashville, Tennesse.

## Theme

Manage the nitrogen cycle

## Solution

Given the task of managing the nitrogen cycle, we chose to target the primary source of excess nitrogen in the environment: abundant use of nitrogen fertilizer. To combat this, we created NitroSense, a platform that combines real-time nitrogen sensor data with weather and climate information to accurately predict the amount of fertilizer to apply.

## Outcome

With our solution, we qualified for the TSA 2025 National Conference and placed first in the NorCal TSA regionals hosted at Mountain House High School.
